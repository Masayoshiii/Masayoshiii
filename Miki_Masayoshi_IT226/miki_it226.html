		<h2>Bio:</h2>
		<p>
		My name is Masayoshi Miki, my friends call me Maki, Yoshi, or Miki. I'm 20 years old
		right now gonna turn 21 years old on May 3. I love singing and dancing even though I'm
		not good at it I also enjoy doing it with friends, family, and relatives. I believe in
		"Knowledge is power" that's why I love learning new things. General knowledge can
		be helpful in studies, but can also help you in real life. I don't have much achievements,
		but I have many great memories. It doesn't mean that I don't want to achieve anything.
		In fact I have something in mind that I need to achieve later in life, I want to have a good
		career and live a good life to make my parents proud and happy.
